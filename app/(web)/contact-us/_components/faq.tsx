              No, using our app will not affect your access to streaming
              services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, or other similar platforms.
              Our app is specifically designed to block certain types of content
              while ensuring that your streaming experience remains
              uninterrupted. The appâ€™s content control and restrictions are
              focused solely on blocking pornographic material and do not
              interfere with legitimate streaming services or other
              non-restricted content.{' '}

              affecting your overall internet speed or bandwidth. Our technology
              ensures that while it provides its content filtering and security
              features, it does not create any noticeable lag or slow down your
              internet connection.{' '}
